A CircleCI Orb to simplify deployments to Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS).

Here are some features that the AWS EKS orb provides:

- Setting up and tearing down of EKS clusters via the `create-cluster` and `delete-cluster` commands / jobs
- Allowing `kubectl` and other tools that access `kubeconfig` (like `helm`) to work with an EKS cluster via the `update-kubeconfig-with-authenticator` command
- Updating deployments with container image updates via the `update-container-image` job
- Installing helm and helm charts (See: `install-helm-on-cluster` and `install-helm-chart`)

## Usage

See the [orb registry listing](http://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/aws-eks) for usage guidelines.

## Requirements

- AWS credential information should be accessible to the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html). The easiest way to provide the information would be to configure [`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html), [`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) and [`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) as CircleCI [project](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project) or [context](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-context) environment variables.

- `curl` should be present in `PATH`.

- A `python` installation present in `PATH` that supports running the AWS CLI

- `pip` if the AWS CLI needs to be installed

## Examples

Full usage examples can be found on the AWS EKS orb's page in the orb registry, [here](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/aws-eks#usage-examples).

A demo project is also available [here](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-aws-eks).
