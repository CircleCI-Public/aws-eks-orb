  Deletes the EKS cluster and resources that were created for it.
  The cluster must have been created with the create_cluster command of the orb.
  It is recommended to delete any kubernetes resources that were deployed to the
  cluster (e.g. resources involving an AWS Elastic Load Balancer)
  before running the delete_cluster command, so that resources can be fully
  removed.
