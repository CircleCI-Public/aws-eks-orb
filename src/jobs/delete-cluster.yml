  Deletes an EKS cluster together with the associated VPC resources on AWS,
  using the eksctl tool. The cluster should have been created with eksctl
  as well.

  It is recommended to delete any kubernetes resources that were deployed to the
  cluster (e.g. resources involving an AWS Elastic Load Balancer)
  before running the delete-cluster command, so that resources can be fully
  removed.
